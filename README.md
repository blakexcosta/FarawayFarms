## RUSTY COLONIES

this is a program designed to be updated and modified for automation of colonies and/or provided instruction for units to perform tasks.

### Brainstorming
Generate citizens and simulate tasks within that colony. Start with infrastructure and food/water needs

okay, colonists now have hp, food and water needs

need to generate a structure representing a planet/area of operation... generated x and y for planet as well as citizen location


This is what to do.
1.  Map out the full feature set for the colony and it's citizens
2. put citizens and colonies into mongo and rework it so interacting with the db.
